orbits
======

Web application that generates SVG orbits from Solar System data.

This application generates an animated SVG graphic plotting orbits of selected bodies which orbit the sun. This application was originally written in 2009 and used selected data from the JPL at NASA converted into XML using JTidy. Unfortunately this script is missing, but the resulting XMLs with data obtained in 2010 are still available.

This application is running here: <http://www.argonavis.com.br/astronomia/orbitas>. 

Here are some screenshots. This is the form to collect the data used to generate the animation:

And this is a screenshot of a rendered SVG:

Another application which plots the data in a table is available at <http://www.argonavis.com.br/astronomia/tabelas>. This is a screenshot of a generated table with selected data:

All the data is in Portuguese.
